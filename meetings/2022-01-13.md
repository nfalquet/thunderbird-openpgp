### Composer window

Nico is half-way through (encryption toggle, menus, and encryption technology
widgets). He still has to update his patch to the new design of the
notifications.

### What build to use for the tests

Create try-run to test WIP patches during the review process (if the patch
under review is almost complete and it only needs few changes)

We can send patches to Alex and Kai for them to create builds for all
platforms.

### Key assistant

1. Alex creates the UI using dummy data to allow us to click through the mockups,
   based on Magnus' patches.
2. Kai has a look at the API and calls that we might need and whatever is missing.
3. Someone wires the UI with the backend (Alex or Magnus).
4. Someone polishes the UI (Alex, Henry).
5. Write tests for the wiring of the UI and the backend (Magnus, Alex, Kai).

Let's use the TOFU ticket to centralize all this:

### Organizing the tests

* Ideas for audience (5-7 people)
  - 1 expert user
  - 2 sporadic users
  - 2 new users
  - non-Thunderbird OpenPGP
* Ideas of things to test
  - 1 minor issue that can be resolved
  - 1 minor issue that cannot be resolved
  - Multiple issues
  - Non obvious scenario
  - Phishing scenario: fake key by email vs. good key on a key server
  - Ideal scenario :)
  - Very extreme scenario
  - Different keys between WKD and key server

### Chat room

Alex will invite the 4 of us in a group chat.
