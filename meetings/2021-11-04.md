Critique of key assistant concepts
==================================

Entry points:

  - [Send] button
  - [Resolve...] button
  - "Manage Keys for Recipients" menu entry (former "View Security Info")
  - When reading email?

Agreements:

  - Have a design that's good for either 1 or multiple recipients.
  - Have a single dialog, no more nested dialogs. Could still open key properties in a popup.
   - Nested dialogs get complicated for accessibly and on some OS.
  - Reuse the existing UI for key properties as much as possible

Side pane:

  * /!\ Long email addresses might be difficult to fit.
  * Previous & Next might be confusing.
  * Lot of things to fit in width (status).

Column:

  * Complex scenario might not look good

Multiple keys discovered online:

- Display key details either in:
  * Doorhanger
  * Another nested dialog

TODO:

- Do an inventory of existing wording and UI elements that we could reuse.
- How to present multiple keys and choose one?
- Have list of keys in a different screen on the same dialog.
- Open key properties in a popup.
- See how the design adapts to different entry points:
  - [Resolve...]: only display recipients with issues
  - *View Security Info*: list all recipients
- Mockup a complicated scenarios:
  * Already have 4 broken keys and 1 collected key
  * The user still wants to discover keys online and gets 3 new keys
  * The user now has to choose 1 between 8 keys
