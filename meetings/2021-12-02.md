### Viewing state

Agreements:

- Reuse the current UI to view keys for now.

We'll keep the latest mockups for future work.

### Key summary info

Different options to open the key properties:

- Link on key id (Magnus)
- Plain link (Alex + Kai + Nico)
- Icon button

We'll start with a plain link.

Key attributes:

- Long key ID
- Creation date

Try to move the link to a 3rd column.

### Scrollbar

Agreements:

- Use a single scrollbar for the entire screen and not multiple scrollbars per
  section.

- Move the Discover and Import buttons to the top of the recipients list to
  prevent them being hidden if the list of recipients gets very long.

### Direct resolution

We could include in the list of recipients, some UI for direct resolution:

- Single key (acceptance)
- Expired key (update)
- Missing key (discovery)
- Multiple keys (choose)

Agreements:

- Make the resolution screen as generic and complete as possible to handle all
  these cases without much added work.

- Add a trust warning to the introduction of the list of recipients and the
  resolution screen.

- Add a help link to the list of recipients.

After that, we can intregrate the most important of these simple cases directly
into the list of recipients, starting with the acceptance of a single key.

### Key import and online discovery

Simplify the log because there might be only 1 key in total in most cases.
