Magnus, Alex, and Nico are confident that we can find a good solution for
"encrypt if possible" on top of what we have already and don't want to block on
more discussions before implementing a first software prototype of the Composer
window and Key Assistant.

In January:

- Alex will work on the UI of the Key Assistant, with help from Henry and Lasana
- Nico will update his patch of the Composer window
- Kai will work on the backend of the Key Assistant

Alex will send us an implementation plan for the Key Assistant, split into
smaller patches.
