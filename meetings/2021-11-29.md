### Resolving state

Agreements:

- Force the user to choose only 1 key, when multiple keys are available
- Use radio buttons for that.

### Viewing state

Displaying which key will actually be used is possible but more
implementation work. Let's try to have a design that can work with or
without this additional complication.

### TODO

- Improve the viewing state

  Explore:

  - Splitting better the valid and accepted keys from the rest:

    * Only showing accepted keys by default and a "Show All" for invalid keys.
    * Splitting keys into 2 sections: valid and invalid.

  - Combining radio for resolving state and dropdowns for viewing state.

The user is not forced to go to the viewing view so it's fine to show
them more complexity when they decide to go there to do some key
management.
